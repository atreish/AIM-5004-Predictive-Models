    "Your company produces an app via which users can post short videos for anyone to view. They can also like, repost, and comment on the videos they view. The key data product is a recommendation engine that determines the order in which videos are shown to a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation engine has a parameter, *theta*, that affects the ordering of the videos. Recently the team of engineers that works on the recommendation engine ran it with different settings of *theta* and, for each setting, measured the amount of time users spent on the app. They have collected these measurements into a data set of 20 samples of (*theta*, *time_spent*) pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, they have identified two auxiliary features (*aux1* and *aux2*) that they hypoithesize should correlate with *time_spent*. These two features are measures of time spent by users in the recent past. The engineers have not verified that the features explain *time_spent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The engineers call these two features \"auxiliary\" because, while they might help explain *time_spent*, the engineers' ultimate interest lies in the dependence of *time_spent* on *theta*.)\n",
